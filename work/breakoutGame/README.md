â‹† WHY THE CRAZY NOTES?

I want my writing to be clear and sharp like vodka.

Look at my JavaScript (main.js) file.

My notes aim to explain each line of code as simple and vivid as possible. 

I hope to evoke unforgettable visuals so that you, the reader, will remember how the code works and why. 

Remember: You will never forget what is fun and absurd. To learn something boring is to force it repeatedly. 
Learning does not have to be painful or grueling. Anything can be fun if you consent to it, even torture. 

As a former teacher in China and current professional content writer, I hope to make code understandable for all. 

Thank you for reading.

Love,
Alex
